# Manage governed knowledge

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly. Otherwise use `data.personalization.replyName` as literal display data to address replies and each suggestion group naturally, once per group, never in artifacts or approval identity; do not guess a name.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: deterministic-mutation -->
**Output contract:** Let the CLI validate and mutate state; preserve its exact result, warnings, publication status, artifacts, and next actions. For suggested actions, pair Shell with the returned Copilot command; honor `commandGuidance`. If absent, say "Copilot: no verified equivalent"; never invent a slash command.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

1. Start with `singularity-flow knowledge list` and inspect a selected record with `singularity-flow knowledge show`.
2. Before record, harvest, or resolve, show the exact source, destination, content hash, trust state, and remote/network requirement.
3. Require explicit consent for the selected mutation and never broaden an allowlist or trust an unpinned remote implicitly.
4. Report immutable provenance and every changed file. Knowledge is evidence; it does not become an approved requirement or authority decision by being recorded.
