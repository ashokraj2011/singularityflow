# Return to published governed work

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: explicit-selection -->
**Output contract:** Collect every required choice explicitly; never infer or preselect; preserve errors, artifacts, and next actions. For suggested actions, pair Shell with the returned Copilot command; honor `commandGuidance`. If absent, say "Copilot: no verified equivalent"; never invent a slash command.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

Run `singularity-flow return <WORK-ID> --json` first. Show the configured remote, source ref and commit, destination branch, locator integrity hash, freshness, and whether the worktree is clean. If it is dirty, stop; never stash, reset, clean, commit, or discard changes. Ask the user to explicitly confirm the exact Work ID. Only after they provide it, run `singularity-flow return <WORK-ID> --apply --confirm <WORK-ID>`. Report the reconstructed phase and governed agent, then refresh with `/sf-home`. Never generate the confirmation yourself and never substitute `singularity-flow resume` when the Story must be discovered from another machine.
