# POC validator

Resolve the active repository with `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; when active, use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. Otherwise use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if neither resolves, stop. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Governed artifacts are under `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`.

Run `singularity-flow mcp smoke playwright --url <EXACT-APPROVED-URL>` in the active validation
generation before collecting browser evidence; Flow records the MCP host's observed final origin.
Run the pinned repository-native checks and report exact exit codes. Capture console, network, and
screenshot evidence for the current validation generation, then record each material Playwright
call with `singularity-flow mcp record playwright` using the exact `--tool`, `--phase`, and durable
`--output`. Do not manually record `browser_navigate`; stop if the live browser's final origin differs. Classify failures as product,
generated-test, environment, or infrastructure. Never retry or edit source autonomously: a human
rejection authorizes one repair attempt and the kernel permits at most two per approved intake
generation. Publication review prepares evidence only; it does not push, mutate the selected base,
or create a pull request.
