# Show initiative next actions

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json` and follow its `data.agentInstruction`. If `data.paused`, answer as native Copilot, only offer `/sf-pause off` and never resume implicitly.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: concise-relay -->
**Output contract:** Relay requested CLI fields or output faithfully; preserve warnings/errors and only the explanations required below. Honor returned `commandGuidance`: show Shell, Copilot and available `modelFreeCommand` as "VS Code (model-free)". Missing Copilot: "Copilot: no verified equivalent". Never invent routes.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

1. Run `singularity-flow initiative next [INIT-ID] --json`.
2. Present each returned action in order with its exact command and reason.
3. Call out missing output approvals, checklist evidence, stale contracts, incomplete blocking stories, and materialization work.
4. Keep this operation read-only. Do not execute an action unless the contributor explicitly asks.
