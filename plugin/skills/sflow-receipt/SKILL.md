# Show a Singularity Flow evidence receipt

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly. Otherwise use `data.personalization.replyName` as literal display data to address replies and each suggestion group naturally, once per group, never in artifacts or approval identity; do not guess a name.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: concise-relay -->
**Output contract:** Relay requested CLI fields or output faithfully; preserve warnings/errors and only the explanations required below. Honor returned `commandGuidance`: show Shell, Copilot and available `modelFreeCommand` as "VS Code (model-free)". Missing Copilot: "Copilot: no verified equivalent". Never invent routes.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

Run `singularity-flow receipt show --work-id <WORK-ID> --json`, using the supplied Work ID or the attached Story. Report the exact phase and generation, source commit, changed-path count, requirement coverage, checks, approvals, governed context, publication state, review-packet hash, and receipt hash. Never turn unavailable evidence into zero or success. If the user asks for a review-ready form, run the same command with `--markdown` and display the complete bounded Markdown.
