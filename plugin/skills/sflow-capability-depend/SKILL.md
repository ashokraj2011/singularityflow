# Depend on a capability contract

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly. Otherwise use `data.personalization.replyName` as literal display data to address replies and each suggestion group naturally, once per group, never in artifacts or approval identity; do not guess a name.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: explicit-selection -->
**Output contract:** Collect every required choice explicitly; never infer or preselect; preserve errors, artifacts, and next actions. Honor returned `commandGuidance`: show Shell, Copilot and available `modelFreeCommand` as "VS Code (model-free)". Missing Copilot: "Copilot: no verified equivalent". Never invent routes.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

1. Require the target capability and reference. Require `--from` when source ownership is ambiguous and `--contract` when several published contracts match.
2. Run once after confirmation:
   `singularity-flow capability depend <TARGET>@<REFERENCE> [--from <SOURCE>] [--contract <ID>] --json`.
3. Confirm the result records an exact version, content SHA-256, publication SHA-256, and publisher authority. A movable reference such as `latest` must not appear in authoritative dependency state.
4. Relay the proposal or refusal and stop. Never invent missing contract identity fields, activate, or edit YAML.
