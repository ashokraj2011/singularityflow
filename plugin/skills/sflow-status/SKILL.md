# Show Singularity Flow status

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: guided-actions -->
**Output contract:** Use read-only CLI evidence, preserve warnings and ordered actions, and change nothing unless explicitly requested. For suggested actions, pair Shell with the returned Copilot command; honor `commandGuidance`. If absent, say "Copilot: no verified equivalent"; never invent a slash command.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

Run `singularity-flow status` with the supplied work ID, if any. Read `STATUS.md` and report the branch, immutable work type, current phase, suggested governed agents, generation, artifacts, token usage, human approval authority groups, threshold, self-approval warnings, publication state, and next valid action. Do not change files or lifecycle state.
