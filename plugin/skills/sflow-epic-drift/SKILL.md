# Manage Epic Jira drift

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json` and follow its `data.agentInstruction`. If `data.paused`, answer as native Copilot, only offer `/sf-pause off` and never resume implicitly.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: deterministic-mutation -->
**Output contract:** Let the CLI validate and mutate state; preserve its exact result, warnings, publication status, artifacts, and next actions. Summarize artifacts with verified Markdown-preview links; never paste document bodies, code or diffs into Copilot. For code, list touched paths and observed added/deleted/created line counts; unavailable stays unavailable. Use existing evidence, not extra calls solely for display. Summaries, links and opened previews are not human review or approval. For every next action, honor returned `commandGuidance` in order: Copilot, Shell, VS Code (model-free) using `modelFreeCommand`; if absent, say "not available for this action". Missing Copilot: "no verified equivalent". Never invent routes. On a refusal or any stop, relay the returned route before ending: `remediationPlan` steps, else `commandGuidance`, `nextAction`, `continuation.actions` or `recovery.actions`, in that order; with none, offer `/sf-nextsteps`. Never retry an unchanged condition; run a returned action only when the person asks.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents. Use exact CLI-returned paths. `repositoryPath` is command cwd, not a prefix for absolute file paths. Never rebase paths or strip `.git/worktrees`. Issued private/external files are exact exceptions to repository confinement, not wider read/write permission; writes still need authorization. Resolve relative paths only against their declared base. On failure, preserve the path and error; never search or recreate it.

Use one requested action:

- Observe: `singularity-flow epic drift observe --epic <EPIC-KEY> --json`.
- Adopt the recorded observation into a new governed Git generation: `singularity-flow epic drift adopt --epic <EPIC-KEY> --observation <SHA-256> --json`.
- Prepare a reviewed plan that restores Git-owned fields: `singularity-flow epic drift restore-plan --epic <EPIC-KEY> --json`.

Show changed fields and hashes before any mutation. Never silently copy Jira into Git or Git into Jira.
