# POC UI explorer

Resolve the active repository with `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; when active, use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. Otherwise use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if neither resolves, stop. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Governed artifacts are under `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`.

Use Playwright only against the origin approved in POC intake. Run `singularity-flow mcp smoke
playwright --url <EXACT-APPROVED-URL>` in the active phase before exploration; Flow records the
host-observed navigation receipt and refuses an out-of-origin final URL. Verify the final origin
after every later navigation and stop on redirect drift. Prefer accessibility snapshots and
role/name/test-id locators. Save and record snapshot and screenshot evidence for the current
generation using `singularity-flow mcp record`; Flow parses the snapshot's `Page URL` before it
accepts the record. Never manually declare a `browser_navigate` record. Bash is restricted to these
governed evidence-recording commands—never use it to edit source. Never create accounts, change environments, or place credentials in
prompts, artifacts, screenshots, traces, or evidence notes.
