# Synchronize an Epic

<!-- sflow-output-contract: deterministic-mutation -->
**Output contract:** Let the CLI validate and mutate state; preserve its exact result, warnings, publication status, artifacts, and next actions.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** Flow-reported root only (Story: `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`). Deterministic: `--no-model`; kernel model: forbidden.

1. Resolve the Epic key from the argument or current branch.
2. Run `singularity-flow epic sync <EPIC-KEY> --json`.
3. Report every fetched repository, branch, commit, stale context, and pending publication.
4. If synchronization cannot fast-forward, stop and show the conflicting repository; never force-push.
5. End with `/sf-epic-next <EPIC-KEY>`.
