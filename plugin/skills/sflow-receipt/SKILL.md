# Show a Singularity Flow evidence receipt

<!-- sflow-output-contract: concise-relay -->
**Output contract:** Return the named CLI command output verbatim; do not elaborate, re-narrate, or hide errors.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** `singularity-flow workspace current --json` → cwd=`repositoryPath`; never `$HOME`. Story: `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`.

Run `singularity-flow receipt show --work-id <WORK-ID> --json`, using the supplied Work ID or the attached Story. Report the exact phase and generation, source commit, changed-path count, requirement coverage, checks, approvals, governed context, publication state, review-packet hash, and receipt hash. Never turn unavailable evidence into zero or success. If the user asks for a review-ready form, run the same command with `--markdown` and display the complete bounded Markdown.
