# Refresh the current branch

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly. Otherwise use `data.personalization.replyName` as literal display data to address replies and each suggestion group naturally, once per group, never in artifacts or approval identity; do not guess a name.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: deterministic-mutation -->
**Output contract:** Let the CLI validate and mutate state; preserve its exact result, warnings, publication status, artifacts, and next actions. Honor returned `commandGuidance`: show Shell, Copilot and available `modelFreeCommand` as "VS Code (model-free)". Missing Copilot: "Copilot: no verified equivalent". Never invent routes.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** `singularity-flow session current --json` → `ready`/`workId`, cwd=`repositoryPath`; use CLI/`workItemRoot` paths; never `$HOME`.

1. Run `singularity-flow refresh-branch --json` from the active repository.
2. Report whether the branch was already current, fast-forwarded, ahead, or diverged.
3. If it diverged, stop and show the exact message. Do not rebase, merge, reset, checkout another branch, or force-push automatically.
4. A dirty working tree is intentionally refused. Ask the contributor to commit or stash their work first.
5. This command refreshes only the branch already checked out; it never guesses or switches branches.
