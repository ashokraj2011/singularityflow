# Show the Epic journey

<!-- sflow-copilot-pause -->
Before any boundary lookup or SFlow action, run `singularity-flow pause status --json`. If `data.paused` is true, do not load SFlow context, run other SFlow commands, enforce phase rules, or render SFlow headings. Handle ordinary requests as native Copilot; explicit SFlow requests only offer `/sf-pause off`. Never resume implicitly.

<!-- sflow-output-contract: concise-relay -->
**Output contract:** Relay requested CLI fields or output faithfully; preserve warnings/errors and only the explanations required below. For suggested actions, pair Shell with the returned Copilot command; honor `commandGuidance`. If absent, say "Copilot: no verified equivalent"; never invent a slash command.
<!-- sflow-execution-boundary -->
**Boundary:** no Story required; cwd=opened Git root or verified `repositoryPath` from `singularity-flow workspace current --json`; refuse if neither resolves; never search `$HOME`/parents.

1. Run `singularity-flow epic journey <EPIC-KEY> --json`.
2. Render Intake → Requirements → Planning → Story publication → developer delivery → Product Owner completion as an arrow flow.
3. Mark the current stage, completed gates, artifacts, owners, and cross-repository handoffs.
4. Distinguish business review in the VS Code extension's Approvals view from work performed through Copilot skills.
5. Do not change lifecycle state.
