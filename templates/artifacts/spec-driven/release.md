# Release conformance — {{work.id}}

The final human-readable trace `[SPK:REQ-042]`. Before publication, add at least one evidence
file below this release artifact's `verification/` directory. Its source-bound index must identify
the approved Verification generation, exact evidence paths and hashes, observed results, and gaps;
this document says what that evidence proves. Do not claim a result absent from approved evidence.

## Requirement trace

Use the complete governed anchors from the approved specification, for example
`[{{work.id}}:REQ-001]` and `[{{work.id}}:AC-001]`. Bare display labels such as `REQ-001` do not
bind release evidence to the approved clause. Put one exact qualified approved clause ID in
each Clause row; a planned source tag or test tag alone is not a release verdict.

| Clause | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `{{work.id}}:REQ-001` | TODO: exact source/test evidence | TODO: matched/partial/missing/deviated/unplanned |

## Constitution conformance

Each cited or evidence-required article, and its verdict. A model may propose evidence, but the
verdict for a judged article is recorded by a human authority `[SPK:CON-044]`.

| Article | Type | Verdict | Recorded by |
|---|---|---|---|

## Exceptions

Every constitution exception, with article, reason, scope, authority, and expiry `[SPK:REQ-103]`.

## Deviations

Accepted deviations carried from convergence, and the authority that accepted each.

## Self-approval disclosures

A conformance report discloses every phase approved by the identity that produced it, with that
identity, so self-approval is never read as independent review.

TODO: List every self-approved phase and the identity that approved it, or explicitly state none.
